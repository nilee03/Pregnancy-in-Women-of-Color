   <p> Maternal Health in Women of color, specifically black women have had poor outcomes such as disproportionate high rates of deaths related to pregancy or childbirth. Socialital and health system factors both play a major part in this as well. Black women are more likely to experience less quality care in the medical systems, along with racial discrimination throughout their lives.</p>
        <br>
       <p> Because of racism,along with sexism and other systemic issues, that contribute to income inequality, Black Women are usually paid 63 cent for every dollar paid to White women. The minimum wage for Black women is $37,227 per year, which is $21,698 less than white women. This means that these women have less money to support themselves along with their families, and are more than likely have to choose between between essential resources like child care, housing, heath care, and food. </p>
        <br> 
      <p> Compared to white women, Black women are are more likely to be unisured, less likely to acces prenatal care, and face greater financial care barriers when they need it. Because of this, Black women experience higher exposure rates to preventable diseases and chronic health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. ANd this means that when, or if a Black Woman decides to have a baby, she is at a much higher risk of these conditions as well as the baby.</p>

         <p> Some matreal issues that come with all this is that Black women are three to four times more likely to experience a pregnancy-related death than white women, Black women are more likely to experience preventable maternal death compared with white women, and Black womenâ€™s heightened risk of pregnancy-related death spans income and education levels.</p>
<br> 
       <p> Black women experience more maternal health complications than white women. Black women are more likely to experience complications throughout the course of their pregnancies than white women.</p>

        </div>
          <!-- PUT INFO AND IMAGES FOR SECTION 3 UNDER HERE  --> <p> Black women deserve to have safe and healthy pregnancies and childbirth. To meaningfully improve Black maternal health outcomes, we need systemic change that starts with the health care system, improves access to care and makes the places Black women live and work healthier, more fair and more responsive to their needs. Only when we do that will Black women be able to achieve their optimal health and well-being throughout their lifespan, including if they choose to become parents. The system has failed Black Families and I feel major changes need to be made.</p>
